# MyPlanner

My Planner is a website where you can plan your time and your activities very easily and fast.
I used the Python language for the My Planner website for all functionalities and some javascript to display some messages, and the entire application was written in PyCharm.

Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the Custom Relationship Management App.

The applications that make up the project are the following:

• Core - this is the main application of the project where I stored the main template for the front page of the store and the Django template for the front page. Also, I created the functionality to see all your plans in this app of the project.

• Account - this is the app of the project where I created the functionalities for login, register, logout, viewing your profile, editing or deleting it,  and the functionality for resetting your password. 

• Plan - this is the app of the project where I created the practicalities such as creating your plans, and editing or deleting them.


Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates and the CSS files used in this project weren't created by me and the website design wasn't a bibg priority for me,  I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
